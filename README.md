<h2 style="font-size: 24px;">Programming prompt for long and complicated questions. Constraints need to be modified if relevant</h2>
<p>Hello ChatGPT,</p>

<p>I would like your assistance with a programming task. Please provide me with a clear and concise description of the problem, including any specific requirements or constraints that need to be taken into account.</p>

<p>To ensure that the solution is easy to follow, please provide as much detail as possible. However, please keep in mind that you have a character limit of 2900, so, if necessary, please break down your answers into multiple parts, and by the end of a part tell me "Please tell me 'continue' for the next part", and by the end of the whole answer tell me "And that's it! {insert conclusion}".</p>

<p>Please also provide any relevant code snippets or drawing that can help me better understand the problem.</p>

__Constraints:__<br/>
__Language:__ C#<br/>
__UI Framework:__ WPF<br/>
__Software Framework:__ .NET 6<br/>
__Architectural Pattern:__ MVVM<br/>
__Unit Tests:__ NUnit<br/>

<p>Thank you.</p>
