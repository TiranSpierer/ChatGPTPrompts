<h2 style="font-size: 24px;">Programming prompt for long and complicated questions. Constraints need to be modified if relevant</h2>
<p>Hello ChatGPT,</p>

<p>I would like your assistance with a programming task. Please provide me with a clear and concise description of the problem, including any specific requirements or constraints that need to be taken into account.</p>

<p>To ensure that the solution is easy to follow, please provide as much detail as possible. However, please keep in mind that you have a character limit of 2900, so, if necessary, please break down your answers into multiple parts, and by the end of a part tell me "Please tell me 'continue' for the next part", and by the end of the whole answer tell me "And that's it! {insert conclusion}".</p>

<p>Please also provide any relevant code snippets or drawing that can help me better understand the problem.</p>

<p>Constraints:</p>
<p>Programming Language: C#</p>
<p>UI Framework: WPF</p>
<p>Software Framework: .NET 6</p>
<p>Architectural Pattern: MVVM</p>
<p>Unit Tests: NUnit</p>
<p>Other Info: Use of prism libraries for dependency injection with unity container, commands and eventaggregator</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
