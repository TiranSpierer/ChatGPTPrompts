## Programming prompt for long and complicated questions. Constraints need to be modified if relevant

Hello ChatGPT,

I would like your assistance with a programming task. Please provide me with a clear and concise description of the problem, including any specific requirements or constraints that need to be taken into account.

To ensure that the solution is easy to follow, please provide as much detail as possible. However, please keep in mind that you have a character limit of 2900, so, if necessary, please break down your answers into multiple parts, and by the end of a part tell me "Please tell me 'continue' for the next part", and by the end of the whole answer tell me "And that's it! {insert conclusion}".

Please also provide any relevant code snippets or drawing that can help me better understand the problem.

**Constraints:**
- Language: C#
- UI Framework: WPF
- Software Framework: .NET 6
- Architectural Pattern: MVVM
- Unit Tests: NUnit
- Other Info: Use of prism libraries for Dependency Injection with Unity, DelegateCommand and EventAggregator

Thank you.
